This is an Amazon Affiliate Promo code webscraper. It will go through the infinite scroll webpage to collect all the information then download it to a data.json file.
This scraper current gets the description, category, link, and start and end date of the promo, though the start/end section does need a little better formatting.
I would recommend using a little jQuery to exclude certain characters. 

Happy scraping!
